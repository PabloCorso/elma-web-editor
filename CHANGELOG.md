# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Ongoing]

- Feedback from @Isty. Remove apple gravity shortcut which conflict with select tool on S (gravity down).

## 2025-12-11

- Improved LGR support and added picture tool (only default distance and clipping for now).
- Update toolbars positioning, controls are back to the left side.
- Added base undo/redo feature.
- Added hand tool for panning the view.

## 2025-12-01

- Updated on feedback from `@insguy`:
  - Instead of canceling add polygon on changing tool, add it.
  - Not clear save and save as do same thing for me (just download lev) - clarified in UI (Chrome only supports file pickers).
  - Increased zoom out/in steps to reduce number of clicks.
  - Changed P (Polygon) to V (Vertex) V is more intuitive and easier to reach.
- Add default LGR support for current kuski, apples, killers and exit objects drawings.

## 2025-11-27

- First Battle by `@insguy` using the level editor: https://elma.online/battles/209393
- Fixed vertex being truncated on download, making close vertices end up with the same coordinates causing internal errors.
- Thanks to `@Markku` for identifying and reporting this issue.

## 2025-11-26

- File session now tracks file handles using [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API)
- Supports save/save-as via the picker with permission checks, and falls back to download when pickers are unavailable.
- Save flow now requests write permission and gracefully falls back to download when saving to disk is blocked.
- Canvas resizing is now batched and preserves the bitmap to avoid flicker while keeping the view fitted to the container.
- Chat/OpenAI toggle controls are hidden to declutter the editor UI when the feature is not in use.

## 2025-11-25

- Hid the chat button for now to declutter the editor UI.
- Updated the file session flow to align picker prompts and save handling.

## 2025-08-03
